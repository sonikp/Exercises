		 * -------Exercise 1.12-------------
		 * Replacing terms with Gender neutral terms, considering 
		 * you been given a list of both possible terms. How would 
		 * you design this application.
		 * 
		 * 1. Create a table of "before" words that contains the replacement
		 * "after" words in a corresponding columns. There should be numerous columns based on 
		 * different actions, or word description, and potentially an replacement accuracy score 
		 * of 100% - 0%
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 2. provide logic that narrows replacement terms in context
		 * of previous words in a sentence. Whether the replacement
		 * word is a noun, verb, adjective, ad-verb, etc. Something 
		 * to do with context.
		 * 
		 * 3. logic to identify the type of document being translated. ie: legal, email, technical
		 * manual, fashion article. Understand document size, book, extract, summary, short story, email.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 4. learning mode, at first have a manual mode setting where the accuracy of the word chosen
		 * provides feedback in terms of scores and ratings to a table/database. This 
		 * can be used to help with future program logic search / replace operations.
		 * 
		 * 4. create a catch-all(male) and a catch-all(female) term that can be manually searched 
		 * for to ensure program can be improved over time.
